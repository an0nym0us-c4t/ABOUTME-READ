# Public Execution of Newton Pud Today
Hello hello! My name is Hizashi, but I also go by Mic or Dave. Whichever one fits your interest. I'm a minor. I like to play and draw.

I really like LittleBigPlanet and Tyler the Creator if it wasn't apparent by my description, pfps or ponies uhhh. I also like MHA, DanDaDan, DSaF, Dialtown and Futurama. Those are like. Past interests though so I don't talk about 'em much. I also like Dandy's World but I don't engage in the fandom really... Anyway my main focuses are LBP and TTC. When I'm not chilling in PT, I like to draw, animate, cosplay and sew. Music that I enjoy a lot includes that of Tyler the Creator (of course), Stomach Book, Femtanyl, Brn1ing Bra1n Sound Industries, Lemon Demon, Will Wood and Jimmy Eat World.

My favorite characters ever include Newton from LBP, Samuel from Tyler the Creator's WOLF, Okarun from DanDaDan, Oboro from MHA, Mayor Mingus from Dialtown and Blackjack from DSaF. Badmouth any of these characters at all and I'm coming for you /srs,,, I love and appreciate these guys very much.
